# Datesavr

Datesavr is an application to allow people to select the best date for an event to take place, based on the responses from other people.

Anyone can file a response to an event. The manage page is available to anyone that has the manage url. Responses can be deleted from the manage page, as well as options being added/removed from the event.

## Setup

Run `bin/setup` to setup your development environment. You'll require `asdf` and the correct version of `ruby` to be installed first.
